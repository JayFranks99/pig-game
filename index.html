      <h1>Read the rules before playing!</h1>

      <p>
        On a turn, a player rolls the dice repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate
        as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the dice.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points
        they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just
        the total earned during that particular roll.
      </p>

      <p>
        A player can also choose to 'hold' if they do not want to take a chance
        of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        The player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn
        are added to their score. When a player reaches a total of 50 or more
        points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
